# SEGAN

This project is an approach to denoise audio samples using GANs based on the SEGAN paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09452) and inspired from its [implementation](https://github.com/santi-pdp/segan). 

In this implementation the TF library was extended and it includes now 1D convolutions which makes it easier to implement the code,

requirements:
* tensorflow 2.0
